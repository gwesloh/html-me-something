                <h2> It All Started With a Mouse</h2>
                <p>Our story, like so many others, started with a Mouse.</p>
                <section>
                    <a id="TheBefore"></a>
                    <h3> The Before </h3>
                    <p>Elizabeth, my Wife, was born in Tucson, Arizona; and grew up in Hemosillo, Sonora in Northern Mexico. I grew up in Dellwood and Ferguson, Missouri. </p>
                    <p>Elizabeth was the youngest of three girls and attended a private all-girls school for kindergarten thru High School.</p>
                    <p>I have two older sisters and come from a large extended family, whom we see often.</p>
                    <p>I attended a coed private grade school in Ferguson followed by a private all-guys high school for a few years before finishing at a coed private high school.</p>
                    <p>I was born with a Disability, I had a stroke before birth and as a result I have spent my entire life with partial paralysis on the left side of my body. For most of my life and in most situations, I have attempted to ignore or draw attention away from my disability because discussing or confronting it is often awkward or uncomfortable, but in recent years I have begun to try for a more balanced approach of acknowledging my limitations while striving to overcome the negative stigma placed on disability in our culture. Due, in large part, to my amazing family, I have never felt truly helpless or trapped by my disability. Although it did take me much longer to learn some basic tasks like tying shoes or riding a bike.</p>
                    <p>Just before her senior year of high school in Hermosillo, Elizabeth was visiting her sister in Tucson. While in Tucson her family was faced with a difficult situation and Elizabeth was forced to get her GED and begin Community College instead of returning home. </p>
                    <p>At roughly the same time I was attending Community College in St. Louis where I was spending most of my time with my best friends. One of these friends, whom I had known since kindergarten, came to me one day and casually announced that she had decided to pursue an internship in Florida. I thought that sounded like a great idea and signed up shortly after.</p>

                        <h3> The Happiest Place on Earth </h3>
                        <p>This is where that Famous Mouse comes in.</p>
                        <p>My friend and I began our internships at Walt Disney World in Mid-January 2008. I was placed in a small fast food restaurant in one of the on-property resorts. As luck would have it, or Magic if you’re a Disneyphile, Elizabeth started an internship at the same restaurant a week or so later. </p>
                        <p>I would like to say it was love at first sight.</p>
                        <p>It wasn’t.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>It took us awhile. I was pursuing another coworker of ours, and Elizabeth did not want a relationship. I had a car though and that was a rare commodity; and after I offered several times to drive her home (gentleman that I was) she accepted, and a friendship began. As we began spending more and more time together feelings began to develop, and I asked her out. She said No.</p>
                        <p>Our friendship continued and eventually she relented and agreed to date. It’s hard to be single at Disney. Romance and magic are everywhere and there is a reason it’s called the happiest place on earth.</p>
                        <p>We went on a date to Epcot. I remember thinking I was so smooth as we found a place to watch the fireworks. I mean, does it get more romantic than lakeside fireworks at Disney? </p>
                        <p>I asked if there was anything I could get her before the fireworks. She asked for a frozen lemonade. Easy enough. </p>
                        <p>I went to the stand just as they were closing, and the cast member said he did not have enough of either flavor for a full cup. I told him I was trying to impress a date and we agreed she would be wowed if I got a mix of both lemonade and raspberry lemonade so as not to return empty handed.</p>
                        <p>We were wrong, but it was still the best date of my life.</p>
                        <p>I would like to say, after all that, it was happily ever after.</p>
                        <p>It wasn’t. </p>

                        <p>We dated for most of our internship with a short break when I got scared of the idea of long distance dating after.

                        <h3> Long Distance Dating, Phoenix, Saint Louis and Marriage</h3>
                        <p>After the internship, we tried the long-distance thing with me in St. Louis and Elizabeth in Tucson and had another short break. Then we both moved to Phoenix and started our life together.</p>
                        <p>Money was tight and after a while of working two jobs to put herself through college, Elizabeth was forced to move back to her family in Tucson. We took another break.</p>
                        <p>Finally, after college she moved back to Phoenix and I asked her to marry me. She said yes.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after, we moved to St. Louis near my family and got married before settling in Ferguson. </p>

                        <h3> Parenthood and Our Goal</h3>
                        <p>In September of 2016 we welcomed our beautiful daughter, Ainsley. We think she is very photogenic, as you will see.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>In the years that have followed we have loved getting to know our daughter and watching her grow, and we hope that she will have siblings soon.</p>
                        <p>We both live with chronic depression and anxiety and each day can bring new challenges, but we try to face them together.</p>
                        <p>We are starting this blog not because we think we are expert parents, but because we know how tough it can be. </p>
                        <p>Elizabeth works full time and I recently left my job as a stock broker and was a SAHD before joining LaunchCode to learn coding. My sister and my parents take care of Ainsley.</p>
                        <p>Life can feel overwhelming at times. Budgeting is tough. Dieting is tough. Sometimes just staying sane is tough. </p>
                        <p>Physically, Mentally, Emotionally, Financially and in every other way Parenthood is Draining</p>
